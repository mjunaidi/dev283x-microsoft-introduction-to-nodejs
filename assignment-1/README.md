## Running it with NodeJS

```
node .
```

Command above will execute `index.js` by using `customer-data.csv` as its input. It will produce a json file in `output` folder with name `customer-data.csv.json`.

To test it with different file of input, we may use `node . <input file name>`. It just the file need to be in the same directory with `index.js`. For example;

```
node . sample-data.csv
```
